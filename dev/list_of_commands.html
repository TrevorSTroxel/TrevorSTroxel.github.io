<title>List of Commands</title>
&nbsp;I. void setup(): This is the most basic part of any Arduino code. This allows the code to run in the first place.<br />
&nbsp;II. void loop(): This is the same as void setup(), but it allows the code to repeatedly.<br />
&nbsp;III. int: Found in most codes in general. Specifies what ever you want to be a integer; ex. int clearPix, int drawmatix, int readButtons.<br />
&nbsp;IV. #define: This is used to set up the PIN number on the Neo Pixel and to tell how many pixels there are with NUMPIXELS.<br />
&nbsp;V. Serial.begin: This allows any serial commands to run in the first place<br />
&nbsp;VI. Serial.print(ln): This is used to print, as in run the code, out the commands that you have set in place. There will sometimes be a ln at the end of Serial.print, this just means it prints it in a list.<br />
&nbsp;VII. for(): This makes any int values do a set command such as being a different color or being brighter than all others. ex. for(j = 0; j < 5 ; j++)<br />
