Java:

    Data Types are int, boolean, and char.

        int is short for integer, which are all positive and negative numbers, including zero. This number could represent the number of visits a website has received or the number of programming languages you know.

        The int data type only allows values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.

        A boolean is a data type that can only be either true or false

        char is short for character and can represent a single character.

        All char values must be enclosed in single quotes, like this: 'G'.

    Multi-line comments are generally longer comments that can span multiple lines. They begin with /* and end with */ .

    The modulo operator - represented in Java by the % symbol - returns the remainder of dividing two numbers.

    Variables are used to store values.

    Whitespace helps make code easy to read for you and others.

    Comments describe code and its purpose.

    Arithmetic Operators include +, -, *, /, and %.

    Relational Operators include <, <=, >, and >=.

        < : less than.

        <=: less than or equal to.

        >: greater than.

        >=: greater than or equal to.

    Equality Operators include == and !=.

        ==: equal to.

        !=: not equal to

    The and operator is represented in Java by &&.

    It returns a boolean value of true only when the expressions on both sides of && are true.

    he or operator is represented in Java by ||.

    It returns a Boolean value of true when at least one expression on either side of || is true.

    The not operator is represented in Java by !.

    It will return the opposite of the expression immediately after it. It will return false if the expression is true, and true if the expression is false.

    However, just like numerical operators, Boolean operators follow rules that specify the order in which they are evaluated. This order is called Boolean operator precedence

        ! is evaluated first

        && is evaluated second

        || is evaluated third

    In Java, the keyword if is the first part of a conditional expression.

    It is followed by a Boolean expression and then a block of code. If the Boolean expression evaluates to true, the block of code that follows will be run.

    The if/else conditional will run the block of code associated with the if statement if its Boolean expression evaluates to true.

    Otherwise, if the Boolean expression evaluates to false, it will run the block of code after the else keyword.

    If the Boolean expression after the if statement evaluates to true, it will run the code block that directly follows.

    Otherwise, if the Boolean expression after the else if statement evaluates to true, the code block that directly follow will run.

    Finally, if all previous Boolean expressions evaluate to false, the code within the else block will run.

    The term ternary comes from a Latin word that means "composed of three parts".

These three parts are:

    A Boolean expression

    A single statement that gets executed if the Boolean expression is true

    A single statement that gets executed if the Boolean expression is false

    The conditional statements that we have covered so far require Boolean expressions to determine which code block to run. Java also provides a way to execute code blocks based on whether a block is equal to a specific value. For those specific cases, we can use the switch statement, which helps keep code organized and less wordy.

    A class is a set of instructions that describe how a data structure should behave.

    A class constructor will allow us to create (Dog) instances. With a class constructor, we can set some information about the (Dog).

    If we do not create a class constructor, Java provides one that does not allow you to set initial information.

    Parameters allow data types to be created with specified attributes

    This is Java's built-in main method. We will learn more about methods and keywords around the main method later on, but first let's understand what the purpose of main is.

        When Java runs your program, the code inside of the main method is executed

    A method is a pre-defined set of instructions. Methods are declared within a class. Java provides some pre-defined methods available to all classes, but we can create our own as well.

    The void keyword indicates that no value should be returned by the method after it executes all the logic in the method. If we do want the method to return a value after it finishes running, we can specify the return type.

    The void keyword (which means "completely empty") indicates to the method that no value is returned after calling that method.

    Alternatively, we can use data type keywords (such as int, char, etc.) to specify that a method should return a value of that type.

    One of the object-oriented programming concepts that allows us to reuse and maintain code more efficiently is called inheritance. It is used to share or inherit behavior from another class.

    Class: a blueprint for how a data structure should function

    Constructor: instructs the class to set up the initial state of an object

    Object: instance of a class that stores the state of a class

    Method: set of instructions that can be called on an object

    Parameter: values that can be specified when creating an object or calling a method

    Return value: specifies the data type that a method will return after it runs

    Inheritance: allows one class to use functionality defined in another class

    When you provide a set of instructions in a method, you might find that a common task is to manipulate an entire set of data. Java conveniently provides control statements to run a task repeatedly. The control statement we will explore is called the for loop.

    Initialization: the int variable named counter is initialized to the value of 0 before the loop is run.

    Test condition: the Boolean expression counter < 5 is a conditional statement that is evaluated before the code inside the control statement is run every loop. If the expression evaluates to true, the code in the block will run. Otherwise, if the expression evalutes to false, the for loop will stop running.

    Increment: Each time the loop completes, the increment statement is run. The statement counter++ increases the value of counter by 1 after each loop.

    The ArrayList stores a list of data of a specified type. ArrayList is a pre-defined Java class. To use it, we must first create an ArrayList object.

    (insertName).add = adds a number to the Interger

    An element's index refers to its location within an ArrayList. ArrayLists in Java are zero-indexed, which means that the first element in an ArrayList is at a position of 0.

    A HashMap contains a set of keys and a value for each key.

    For Loops: used to repeatedly run a block of code

    For Each Loops: a concise version of a for loop

    ArrayList: stores a list of data

    HashMap: stores keys and associated values like a dictionary
      Javascript

    the // sign is for comments. A comment is a line of text that JavaScript won't try to run as code. It's just for humans to read.

    These boxes can be used on websites to confirm things with users. confirm("(insert something)");

    To do any of these actions, the program needs an input. You can ask for input with a prompt. prompt("What is your name?");

    numbers are quantities, just like you're used to. You can do math with them.

    strings are sequences of characters, like the letters a-z, spaces, and even numbers. These are all strings: "Ryan", "4" and "What is your name?" Strings are extremely useful as labels, names, and content for your programs.

    To make a number in your code, just write a number as numerals without quotes

    console.log() = will take whatever is inside the parentheses and log it to the console below your code

    List of comparison operators: > Greater than, < Less than, <= Less than or equal to, >= Greater than or equal to, === Equal to, !== Not equal to

    An if statement is made up of the if keyword, a condition like we've seen before, and a pair of curly braces { }. If the answer to the condition is yes, the code inside the curly braces will run.

    ( ): control order of operations

    * and /: multiplication and division

    - and +: subtraction and addition

    Let's meet an interesting symbol called modulo. When % is placed between two numbers, the computer will divide the first number by the second, and then return the remainder of that division.

    "some word".substring(x, y) where x is where you start chopping and y is where you finish chopping the original string.

    To do more complex coding, we need a way to 'save' the values from our coding. We do this by defining a variable with a specific, case-sensitive name. Once you create (or declare) a variable as having a particular name, you can then call up that value by typing the variable name. var varName = data;
